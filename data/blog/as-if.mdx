As if I’m lost in darkness,<br/>
As if there’s no sound.<br/>
As if I’m lifeless,<br/>
Yet my heart pounds.<br/>

As if I cry and smile,<br/>
At the same time.<br/>
As if I sing and mourn,<br/>
In the same rhyme.<br/>

As if someone I could hear,<br/>
As if I’m numb within fear.<br/>
As if someone dear,<br/>
Yet I’m broken into tear.<br/>

As if we laugh,<br/>
As if each of us is half.<br/>
As if we love,<br/>
As if pieces of a broken heart.<br/>

As if two poles of earth,<br/>
As if to feel each other’s dearth.<br/>
