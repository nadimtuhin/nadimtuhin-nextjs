---

If you've been using OpenLens to manage your Kubernetes clusters, I have bad news: **it's no longer being maintained**. The last update was months ago, and the community has moved on.

But here's the good news: the Kubernetes dashboard ecosystem has exploded with alternatives. After testing 13 different tools across my production and dev clusters, I've compiled this comprehensive guide to help you find your next Kubernetes UI.

## TL;DR: My Top Picks

| Use Case                  | Tool         | Why                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Terminal power users**  | K9s          | Fastest, most efficient, works over SSH |
| **Teams needing web UI**  | Headlamp     | CNCF Sandbox project, modern UI         |
| **Mobile monitoring**     | Kubenav      | Only option with iOS/Android apps       |
| **Full DevOps lifecycle** | Devtron      | Built-in CI/CD, security scanning       |
| **Vim users**             | kubectl.nvim | Never leave your editor                 |

## Why OpenLens Died (And What to Do About It)

Lens started as an open-source project but gradually moved toward a commercial model. The community fork, OpenLens, kept the open-source dream alive—until it didn't. Development stalled, bugs went unfixed, and security patches stopped coming.

The good news? A new fork called **[Freelens](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens)** has picked up where OpenLens left off. But if you want to explore what else is out there, read on.

## Making the Right Choice

Selecting the right Kubernetes dashboard depends on your specific needs:

- **For terminal enthusiasts**: K9s offers unmatched speed and efficiency
- **For Vim users**: kubectl.nvim provides seamless editor integration
- **For teams needing a web interface**: Headlamp provides a modern, accessible solution
- **For mixed container environments**: Portainer offers unified management
- **For local development**: Rancher Desktop provides an all-in-one experience
- **For on-the-go monitoring**: Kubenav's mobile support is unmatched
- **For DevOps-focused teams**: Devtron offers end-to-end application lifecycle management
- **For security-focused operations**: Karpor provides specialized security visualization
- **For beginners seeking simplicity**: Seabird or Cyclops offer intuitive interfaces
- **For managing multiple clusters**: KubeClipper provides comprehensive multi-cluster management

## The Future of Kubernetes Dashboards

The Kubernetes dashboard ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly. As Kubernetes itself matures, we can expect dashboards to focus more on:

- Enhanced security features and compliance monitoring
- Better integration with GitOps workflows
- Improved performance visualization and troubleshooting
- AI-assisted operations and anomaly detection
- Tighter integration with service mesh and serverless frameworks
- More specialized dashboards for specific use cases
- Improved accessibility and reduced resource requirements

## My Personal Setup

After months of testing, here's what I actually use:

1. **K9s** — My daily driver for quick cluster checks and debugging. Nothing beats the speed of terminal-based navigation.
2. **Headlamp** — Deployed in-cluster for team members who prefer a web UI. The CNCF backing gives me confidence in its longevity.
3. **Kubenav** — On my phone for weekend on-call monitoring. Being able to check pod status from anywhere is invaluable.

## Migration Path from OpenLens

If you're currently on OpenLens, here's my recommended migration:

1. **Try Freelens first** — It's the closest thing to OpenLens and requires minimal adjustment
2. **Learn K9s on the side** — Even if you stick with a GUI, K9s will make you faster
3. **Evaluate Headlamp for team use** — If you need shared access, it's the most production-ready web option

## Final Thoughts

The death of OpenLens is actually a blessing in disguise. The Kubernetes dashboard ecosystem is healthier and more diverse than ever. Whether you're a terminal purist, a GUI lover, or somewhere in between, there's a tool that fits your workflow perfectly.

Don't just pick one—try a few. Most are open-source and can be installed in minutes. Your future self will thank you for knowing multiple tools when that 3 AM incident happens.
