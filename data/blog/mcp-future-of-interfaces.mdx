summary: 'The Model Context Protocol promised to be the USB-C for AI. Then it went sideways—and what emerged might be even more revolutionary.'
---

Imagine a world where you never click another dropdown menu. Where "find all overdue invoices and send reminders" just happens—no logging into three apps, no copy-pasting between tabs, no learning yet another interface designed by someone who isn't you.

Now imagine the infrastructure that makes this possible. That's what the Model Context Protocol (MCP) was supposed to be.

But here's the twist: MCP's original vision had a fatal flaw. And the fix might matter more than the protocol itself.

## TL;DR: The Interface Revolution (And Its Plot Twist)

| Era | Interface | Key Innovation | What Died |
|-----|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **1970s** | CLI → GUI | Mouse, windows, icons | Command memorization |
| **1984** | Mainstream GUI | Apple Macintosh | DOS dominance |
| **2007** | Desktop → Mobile | iPhone touch | Physical keyboards |
| **2024-2026** | GUI → Agentic | MCP + Code Execution | Point-and-click navigation |

The Model Context Protocol isn't just another API standard. It's the "USB-C for AI"—but the real breakthrough is what happens when you combine it with code execution.

## What's Actually Happening

In November 2024, Anthropic quietly released MCP as an open standard. Within 12 months, it became the de facto protocol for connecting AI to external tools. The timeline is remarkable:

- **March 2025**: OpenAI officially adopted MCP across all products
- **May 2025**: Microsoft announced MCP support in Windows 11 at Build
- **September 2025**: Cloudflare released "Code Mode"—a fundamental rethinking of how agents use MCP
- **November 2025**: Anthropic published their code execution approach, claiming 98.7% token reduction
- **December 2025**: Anthropic donated MCP to the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (co-founded with OpenAI and Block)
- **Today**: 10,000+ public MCP servers, with Stripe, GitHub, Notion, Salesforce, and SAP all shipping official integrations

Google DeepMind integrated native MCP support into Gemini. JetBrains built it into their IDEs. The W3C is scheduled to begin formal discussions on "MCP-Identity" in April 2026—essentially digital passports for AI agents.

This isn't hype. This is infrastructure being laid.

## The USB-C Analogy

Before USB-C, connecting devices was chaos. Each manufacturer had proprietary connectors. You needed a drawer full of cables. MCP solves the same problem for AI.

**The M×N Problem:**
If you have M AI models and N external tools, you traditionally needed M×N custom integrations. Every model had its own way of calling APIs. Every tool needed custom adapters for every model.

**MCP's Solution:**
One universal protocol. M+N components instead of M×N. Write an MCP server once, and any AI model can use it. Build an MCP client into your model, and it can access any server.

```
Before MCP:
┌─────────┐     custom     ┌─────────┐
│ Claude  │──────────────▶│ GitHub  │
│ GPT-4   │──────────────▶│ Slack   │
│ Gemini  │──────────────▶│ Notion  │
└─────────┘  9 integrations └─────────┘

After MCP:
┌─────────┐                ┌─────────┐
│ Claude  │─┐              │ GitHub  │
│ GPT-4   │─┼──▶ MCP ◀───┼│ Slack   │
│ Gemini  │─┘              │ Notion  │
└─────────┘  6 components  └─────────┘
```

This isn't a minor efficiency gain. It's the difference between the early web's proprietary networks and the open internet built on TCP/IP and HTTP.

## MCP's Dirty Secret: Context Bloat

Here's what the hype cycle missed: MCP had a serious problem.

MCP clients load all tool definitions upfront. With thousands of connected tools, agents process hundreds of thousands of tokens before reading a single user request. In Anthropic's own testing, a modest five-server setup with 58 tools consumed approximately **55,000 tokens** before the conversation even started.

Half your context window—gone before you type a single instruction.

Worse, as Cloudflare's engineering team discovered: **LLMs are actually bad at tool calling**. The special tokens used in tool calls are things LLMs have never seen in the wild. They're synthetic patterns with no real-world training data. The models struggle with them in ways they don't struggle with... code.

## The Plot Twist: Code Mode

The solution came from an unexpected direction. Instead of fixing tool calling, Cloudflare and Anthropic independently arrived at the same insight: **let agents write code instead**.

**Cloudflare's Code Mode:**
Convert MCP tools into TypeScript APIs. Instead of exposing tools directly, give the agent one tool: a code execution sandbox. The LLM writes TypeScript that calls the APIs. Code runs in V8 isolates—lightweight, sandboxed JavaScript environments that spin up in milliseconds.

> "LLMs are better at writing code to call MCP than at calling MCP directly."

**Anthropic's Approach:**
Present MCP servers as code APIs through a filesystem structure. Each tool becomes a TypeScript file with defined interfaces. Agents explore directories, load only the definitions they need, and execute operations in a sandboxed environment.

The result? **98.7% token reduction**—from 150,000 tokens to just 2,000 tokens in their benchmark.

**Why This Works:**

| Traditional MCP | Code Execution Mode |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Load all tool definitions upfront | Discover tools on-demand |
| Every result passes through the model | Data processed in sandbox, only results returned |
| Special tokens LLMs struggle with | TypeScript syntax LLMs know intimately |
| Linear tool-by-tool execution | Loops and conditionals execute natively |

This is the real paradigm shift. Not MCP alone—but MCP plus code execution.

## Why Traditional Interfaces Are Dying

The WIMP paradigm (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) has dominated for 50 years. It was revolutionary when Xerox PARC invented it, and transformative when Apple brought it to consumers. But it's now a bottleneck.

**The Core Problem:**
GUIs force users to learn software. You study the menu structure, memorize shortcuts, navigate hierarchies designed by someone who isn't you. The software dictates how you work.

**The Agentic Alternative:**
Natural language + MCP + code execution inverts this entirely. You state your intent. The AI writes code to orchestrate the execution. You say "find all overdue invoices and send reminders," and the agent generates a script that queries your accounting software, filters the results, drafts personalized emails, and sends them—all without showing you a single screen.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt put it bluntly: "User interfaces are largely going to go away."

Jakob Nielsen, the usability pioneer, calls this the first new UI paradigm in decades—one that "reverses the locus of control."

## The Agentic Operating System

An essay from Serious Insights argues that Windows, macOS, and Linux will become "legacy interfaces" within 3-5 years. Not because they'll stop working, but because they'll stop mattering.

The argument goes like this:

| Traditional OS | Agentic OS |
|----------------|------------|
| File-based storage | Semantic/vector-native storage |
| Deterministic kernel | Probabilistic kernel (managing intent under uncertainty) |
| You launch apps | Agents orchestrate services |
| Files and folders | Knowledge graphs and context |

> "An agentic operating system doesn't start with files and apps. It starts with meaning."

The threat isn't technical inferiority—it's **relevance**. When users' primary computing relationship becomes orchestration with intelligent agents, traditional OS kernels become implementation details. Nobody cares what kernel runs underneath if the "real OS" is the orchestration layer.

Microsoft clearly sees this. At Build 2025, they introduced:
- MCP as a foundational layer in Windows 11
- "Ask Copilot on the taskbar"—unified entry point for agents
- "@" mentions to invoke agents directly from the taskbar
- Agent permissions managed at the OS level

They're not fighting the shift. They're trying to own it.

## What This Means for Software

If agents become the primary interface, traditional SaaS has a problem.

**The SaaS model depends on:**
- Users logging in
- Users clicking through interfaces
- Users learning your product
- Users spending time in your app

**Agentic computing eliminates all of this.**

When an AI agent can accomplish the task without ever showing a screen, what are you selling? The value shifts from "interface to accomplish X" to "capability to accomplish X." The UI becomes irrelevant.

Some predictions from the research:

- **Gartner**: By 2028, AI agent ecosystems will enable networks of specialized agents to dynamically collaborate across applications
- **Salesforce**: "We're at the beginning of a major transformation in which autonomous AI agents will become the new user interface"
- **Industry analysts**: The entire SaaS economy could be disrupted as agents complete tasks end-to-end

## The Critical Perspectives

This isn't all utopia. There are real challenges:

**Security:**
In April 2025, researchers identified serious MCP vulnerabilities: tool poisoning, prompt injection, cross-server shadowing. When agents can take actions on your behalf—and now execute arbitrary code—the attack surface expands dramatically. Cloudflare's V8 isolate approach helps, but this remains an active concern.

**Reliability:**
Carnegie Mellon research found that when testing agents in simulated companies, none could complete a majority of assigned tasks. Agents are impressive demos but inconsistent workers. Code execution helps with efficiency, not accuracy.

**The "Lowest Common Denominator" Problem:**
Benedict Evans points out that MCP, as middleware abstracting various APIs, can't fully support all features of underlying tools. Standardization means compromise.

**Determinism:**
Enterprises need predictable software. AI is probabilistic. A CFO closing quarterly books needs the same inputs to yield the same outputs every time. Code-generating agents don't guarantee that.

**Operational Complexity:**
Code execution requires "secure execution environments with appropriate sandboxing, resource limits, and monitoring," as Anthropic notes. This isn't plug-and-play infrastructure.

## What I'm Watching

**Near-term (2026):**
- W3C discussions on MCP-Identity (agent authentication)
- Code Mode adoption beyond Cloudflare
- Security frameworks maturing around sandboxed execution

**Medium-term (2027-2028):**
- Agent-to-agent communication standards (Google's Agent2Agent protocol)
- First "agentic-native" applications (no traditional UI at all)
- OS-level agent sandboxing and permissions

**Long-term (2030+):**
- Possible: Traditional GUIs become accessibility features
- Possible: Natural language becomes the primary programming interface
- Unknown: What "using a computer" even means

## Final Thoughts

The Mac didn't kill the command line. It made it optional—a power user tool rather than a requirement. The same thing is happening now, but in reverse.

Traditional GUIs won't disappear overnight. But they're becoming the legacy interface—the thing you fall back to when the agent can't handle it, rather than the primary way you interact with software.

MCP is the infrastructure enabling this shift. Code execution is what makes it practical. Together, they represent something genuinely new: not just AI that can use tools, but AI that can write programs to orchestrate tools—on the fly, in milliseconds, at a fraction of the cost.

The original MCP vision was ambitious. The code execution pivot made it viable.

That's how revolutions actually work. Not with the first idea, but with the correction that makes the first idea real.
