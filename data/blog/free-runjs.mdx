summary: 'How I built a free alternative to RunJS in a weekend to make JavaScript testing and experimentation easier'
---

As a developer, I frequently found myself needing a quick way to test JavaScript code snippets. While tools like RunKit existed, they weren't always reliable, and the paid alternatives like RunJS, though excellent, weren't accessible to everyone. This pain point led me to create Free RunJS - an open-source alternative that I built over a weekend.

## The Problem

Testing JavaScript code snippets often involves a cumbersome process:

- Setting up a new Node.js project
- Installing dependencies
- Creating test files
- Running the code

While RunKit was a go-to solution for many developers, its inconsistent availability became a significant issue. The paid alternative, RunJS, offered a great experience but wasn't accessible to everyone.

## The Solution

Free RunJS ([live demo](https://runjs.app.nadimtuhin.com/)) is a web-based JavaScript playground that allows developers to:

- Write and execute JavaScript code instantly
- Test code snippets without any setup
- Share code easily with others
- Access a clean, distraction-free coding environment

## Development Process

I leveraged modern development tools to build this project efficiently:

- Used Cursor.sh as my primary IDE, which significantly boosted productivity
- Started with a clear product requirements document (PRD) generated with ChatGPT
- Focused on creating a minimal viable product (MVP) over a weekend
- Prioritized user experience and simplicity

## Technical Implementation

The project is built with:

- Next.js for the frontend framework
- Monaco Editor for the code editing experience
- Server-side code execution with proper sandboxing
- Real-time code evaluation and output display

## Future Plans

While the current version serves its purpose well, I'm planning to add more features:

- Support for multiple files and modules
- Better error handling and debugging tools
- More sharing options
- Enhanced code completion and suggestions

## Try It Out

You can try Free RunJS at [https://runjs.app.nadimtuhin.com/](https://runjs.app.nadimtuhin.com/) or check out the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/nadimtuhin/free-runjs).

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to make this tool even better for the developer community.
