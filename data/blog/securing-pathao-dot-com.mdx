Hey there! Today, I want to share how we secured Pathao.com, one of the largest ride-sharing platforms in South Asia. When you're serving millions of users across multiple countries, security isn't just a checkbox—it's a critical foundation of your infrastructure.

In this post, I'll walk you through our security implementation, from basic nginx configurations to advanced attack prevention. Whether you're running a WordPress site or any web application, you'll find practical security measures you can implement today.

# The Challenge

Pathao.com runs on WordPress multisite, serving content in three languages:

- Main site (English): `/`
- Bengali site: `/bn`
- Nepali site: `/np`

Each site needs its own security considerations while maintaining consistent protection across the platform. We faced several critical challenges:

1. **High-Value Target**: As one of South Asia's leading tech companies, we were constantly targeted by:

   - Automated vulnerability scanners
   - Malicious bots and crawlers
   - SQL injection attempts
   - Brute force login attacks

2. **Performance Impact**: Security scanning tools were causing:

   - High server CPU usage from repeated scanning
   - Increased bandwidth consumption
   - Slower response times for legitimate users
   - Occasional server timeouts during peak scan periods

3. **Multilingual Complexity**: Managing security across three different sites meant:

   - More entry points to protect
   - Complex URL patterns to secure
   - Different content types requiring varied security rules
   - Maintaining consistent security across all language variants

4. **WordPress-Specific Vulnerabilities**: Being on WordPress meant dealing with:
   - Plugin security vulnerabilities
   - Theme security issues
   - Core WordPress exploits
   - File upload vulnerabilities

Let's dive into how we tackled this!

# Security Implementation

## 1. Security Headers

First, we implemented essential security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

```nginx
# Prevent version disclosure
server_tokens off;

# HSTS for enforcing HTTPS
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains;";

# Prevent clickjacking attacks
add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;

# Disable content-type sniffing
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

# Enable XSS protection
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
```

These headers form our first line of defense against various attack vectors.

## 2. Basic Security Measures

We implemented several fundamental security measures:

```nginx
# Prevent directory listing
autoindex off;

# Block double slash in URLs
location ~* //wp-content {
    return 403;
}

# Block hidden files (like .git, .htaccess)
location ~ /\. { deny all; }

# Handle favicon and robots.txt efficiently
location = /favicon.ico {
    log_not_found off;
    access_log off;
}

location = /robots.txt {
    allow all;
    log_not_found off;
    access_log off;
    try_files $uri /index.php?$args;
}
```

## 3. WordPress Core Protection

We implemented strict access controls for WordPress core files and functionality:

```nginx
# Block XML-RPC access
location ~* "xmlrpc.php" { deny all; }
location ~* "readme.txt" { deny all; }

# Protect sensitive WordPress directories
location ~* wp-admin/includes { deny all; }
location ~* wp-includes/theme-compat/ { deny all; }
location ~* wp-includes/js/tinymce/langs/.*\.php { deny all; }

# Block access to configuration files
location ~ /(\.|wp-config.php|readme.html|license.txt) { deny all; }

# Block temp files
location ~ ~$ { access_log off; log_not_found off; deny all; }

# Block archive files
location ~* ^/(wp-content)/(.*?)\.(text|txt|zip|gz|tar|bzip2|7z)$ { deny all; }
```

## 4. Upload Directory Security

Comprehensive protection for upload directories:

```nginx
# Block backup directories
location ~ ^/wp-content/uploads/sucuri { deny all; }
location ~ ^/wp-content/updraft { deny all; }

# Protect plugin/theme documentation
location ~* ^/wp-content/plugins/.+\.(txt|log|md)$ {
    deny all;
    error_page 403 =404 / ;
}

# Secure multisite uploads
location ~* ^/wp-content/uploads/sites/\d+/ {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    location ~ \.php$ {
        deny all;
    }
}

# Block PHP execution in uploads
location ~* /wp-content/uploads/.*\.php$ {
    deny all;
}

# Block restricted file types in uploads
location ~* ^/wp-content/uploads/.*.(html|htm|shtml|php|js|swf|css)$ {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "Restricted Upload File Type" always;
    deny all;
    error_page 403 =404 / ;
}
```

## 5. Attack Prevention

### SQL Injection Protection

```nginx
# Block SQL injection attempts
location ~* "(\'|\")(.*)(drop|insert|md5|select|union)" {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "SQL Injection Attempt" always;
    deny all;
}
```

### Path Traversal Prevention

```nginx
# Block path traversal attempts
location ~ "(\\|\.\.\.|\.\./|~|`|<|>|\|)" {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "Path Traversal" always;
    deny all;
}
```

### File Inclusion & CGI Protection

```nginx
# Block sensitive file extensions
location ~* \.(engine|inc|info|install|make|module|profile|test|po|sh|.*sql|theme|tpl(\.php)?|xtmpl)$ {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "Sensitive File Extension" always;
    return 444;
}

# Block CGI execution
location ~* \.(pl|cgi|py|sh|lua)$ {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "CGI/Script Execution Not Allowed" always;
    return 444;
}
```

### Documentation & Backup Protection

```nginx
# Block access to documentation files
location ~* "/(^$|readme|license|example|README|LEGALNOTICE|INSTALLATION|CHANGELOG)\.(txt|html|md)" {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "Documentation File Protected" always;
    deny all;
}

# Block access to backup files
location ~* "\.(old|orig|original|php#|php~|php_bak|save|swo|aspx?|tpl|sh|bash|bak?|cfg|cgi|dll|exe|git|hg|ini|jsp|log|mdb|out|sql|svn|swp|tar|rdf)$" {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "Backup/Log File Protected" always;
    deny all;
}
```

### XSS & Command Injection Protection

```nginx
# Block XSS attempts
location ~* "(<|%3C).*script.*(>|%3)" {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "XSS Attempt" always;
    deny all;
}

# Block remote file inclusion attempts
location ~* "(https?|ftp|php):/" {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "Remote File Inclusion Attempt" always;
    deny all;
}

# Block command injection attempts
location ~ "(~|`|<|>|:|;|%|\\|\s|\{|\}|\[|\]|\|)" {
    add_header X-Block-Reason "Command Injection Attempt" always;
    deny all;
}
```

# Performance Optimization

While security was our primary focus, we also implemented performance optimizations to ensure fast content delivery.

## 1. Direct Static File Serving

Instead of proxying to Apache, we serve static files directly through nginx for better performance:

```nginx
# Multilingual static asset handling
location ~* ^/(bn|np)?/.*\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js|svg|woff2)$ {
    access_log off;
    expires max;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
    add_header X-Static-File "true";
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
```

This configuration:

- Handles files for all language variants
- Implements aggressive caching
- Bypasses Apache completely for static content
- Reduces server load significantly

## 2. WordPress Content Optimization

We apply similar optimizations to WordPress content:

```nginx
# WordPress content handling
location ~* ^/(bn|np)?/wp-content/ {
    access_log off;
    expires max;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
    add_header X-Static-File "true";
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
```

# Dealing with Bounty Hunters and Security Scanners

One of the biggest challenges we faced was the constant load from bounty hunters and automated security scanners. As a prominent tech company in South Asia, Pathao.com was a frequent target for:

- Bug bounty hunters running automated scans
- Security researchers testing for vulnerabilities
- Automated vulnerability scanners and bots
- Penetration testing tools running continuous scans

These activities were creating significant server load and occasionally impacting site performance. Our security implementations helped in several ways:

1. **Early Request Filtering**: By blocking malicious patterns at the nginx level, we prevented these requests from reaching the application server
2. **Reduced Server Load**: Security scanners often make thousands of requests testing for vulnerabilities - our rules block these at the edge
3. **Resource Protection**: Rules preventing access to sensitive paths and files meant fewer server resources wasted on handling these requests
4. **Improved Response Times**: By blocking known attack patterns early in the request cycle, we maintained better response times for real users

The implementation effectively created a robust shield, allowing legitimate traffic through while filtering out potentially harmful automated scans.

# The Results

After implementing these security measures, we've seen:

1. **Zero Security Incidents**: No successful attacks or breaches in production
2. **Better Performance**: Our security layers actually helped improve site speed by blocking malicious requests early
3. **Lower Server Load**: By blocking bad bots and attacks at the nginx level, we reduced unnecessary load on our application servers
4. **Improved SEO**: Search engines love secure sites, and our security headers helped boost our rankings

The best part? These security measures are battle-tested in production, serving thousands of users daily. They're not just theoretical—they work.
