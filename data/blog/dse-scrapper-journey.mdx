---

Back in 2015, during the peak of my PHP development days, I embarked on an ambitious journey to create a comprehensive stock market platform. The [DSE Scrapper](https://github.com/nadimtuhin/dse-scrapper) project was born out of my enthusiasm for the stock market and a desire to make market data more accessible to Bangladeshi investors.

## The Vision

The project started with a grand vision: to build a complete stock market platform featuring:

- Real-time stock listings
- Portfolio management
- Market analysis tools
- Historical data tracking

As a PHP developer heavily influenced by Laravel patterns, I approached this project with the intention of creating a robust and maintainable codebase.

## The Challenge

The primary challenge was accessing data from the Dhaka Stock Exchange. Web scraping seemed like the obvious solution, but it came with its own set of obstacles:

- **Access Restrictions**: DSE's website initially blocked scraping attempts
- **Data Structure**: The need to parse and structure the scraped data effectively
- **Real-time Updates**: Handling frequent data updates without overwhelming the server

## The Breakthrough

The key breakthrough came when I discovered that adding a referrer header to the cURL requests would allow successful scraping. This simple yet crucial finding made the entire project possible:

```php
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_REFERER, 'http://www.dse.com.bd');
```

## Code Architecture

The project followed Laravel-inspired patterns:

- **Clean separation of concerns** - Controllers, services, and models
- **Service-based architecture** - Reusable scraping components
- **Robust error handling** - Graceful failure recovery
- **Configurable parameters** - Flexible scraping options

## Learning Outcomes

While the project didn't reach its full potential due to work commitments and time constraints, it provided valuable lessons:

- **Technical Skills**: Deep dive into web scraping techniques and data processing
- **Project Management**: Understanding the importance of scope management
- **Persistence**: The value of solving technical challenges step by step

## Impact and Legacy

Though the project remained incomplete, it served as:

- A learning platform for understanding stock market data structures
- A template for future web scraping projects
- A reminder that even unfinished projects contribute to our growth as developers

## Final Thoughts

The DSE Scrapper project, while not reaching its ambitious goals, represents an important chapter in my development journey. It showcases how enthusiasm for a domain combined with technical skills can lead to interesting projects, and how even "incomplete" projects can provide valuable learning experiences.

The project remains open-source for anyone interested in building upon it or learning from its approach to web scraping.
