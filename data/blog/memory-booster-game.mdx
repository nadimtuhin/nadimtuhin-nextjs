# Memory Booster: When Procrastination Leads to Innovation

Sometimes, the most interesting projects emerge from moments of procrastination. That's exactly how Memory Booster came to be - a side project born during a time when I was supposed to be implementing a WebRTC calling feature for a chat application.

## The Genesis

In mid-2016, while working on a chat application, I found myself in a peculiar state of mind. The WebRTC calling feature I was supposed to implement felt daunting, and like many developers, I chose to channel that energy into something completely different - a memory game.

## Technical Stack: Embracing MobX

At that time, I was getting a bit tired of the Redux boilerplate in my day-to-day work. Don't get me wrong - Redux is fantastic for large applications, but sometimes you want something lighter, something different. That's when I decided to experiment with MobX.

MobX offered a refreshingly simple approach to state management:

- Less boilerplate code
- More straightforward state updates
- Intuitive reactive programming model

## Testing with Jest Snapshots

One of the exciting aspects of this project was implementing Jest snapshot testing. It was a relatively new feature at the time, and it provided a fantastic way to ensure UI consistency:

- Quick test writing
- Easy visual diffing
- Simplified regression testing

## The Game Implementation

Memory Booster is a classic memory card game where players need to match pairs of cards. The implementation focuses on:

- Clean, minimalist UI
- Smooth animations
- Responsive design
- Score tracking

## Learning Outcomes

While this project started as a form of procrastination, it ended up being an invaluable learning experience:

- Gained hands-on experience with MobX
- Mastered Jest snapshot testing
- Learned about game state management
- Explored animation implementations in React

## Reflections

Looking back, while MobX provided a pleasant development experience for this small project, I still maintain that Redux is often the better choice for larger applications. The structure and predictability it provides become increasingly valuable as applications grow in complexity.

## Try It Out

Sometimes, the best projects come from moments when we're supposed to be doing something else. Memory Booster stands as a testament to how procrastination, combined with curiosity about new technologies, can lead to meaningful learning experiences.
