# From Parent's Concern to Educational Innovation: The Story of BanglaABC123

As a parent and software engineer, I found myself in a familiar situation - my kids had their exams approaching, and they needed help learning numbers in both English and Bengali. Instead of sticking to traditional flashcards and repetitive exercises, I decided to turn this challenge into an opportunity to create something special.

## Why I Built BanglaABC123

The idea struck me when I noticed how engaged my children were with their mobile games. Why not channel that same enthusiasm into learning? That's how BanglaABC123 was born - a game that transforms the sometimes tedious task of learning numbers into an exciting matching adventure.

## What Makes It Special

I designed the game with my kids in mind, incorporating features that I knew would keep them engaged:

- **Interactive Card Matching**: The core gameplay revolves around finding matching pairs of cards, making learning feel like a treasure hunt rather than a study session.
- **Child-Friendly Customization**: My kids love being able to:
  - Choose how many cards they want to play with
  - Toggle cute animal icons on and off
  - Pick their favorite colors
- **Progress Saving**: Because my children often want to pick up where they left off, the game remembers their settings and progress.
- **Works Everywhere**: Whether they're using my phone, their tablet, or our desktop computer, the game adapts perfectly to any screen.

## The Technical Side

As a developer, I wanted to ensure the game was not just fun but also performant and maintainable. I built it using:

- React for the interactive UI
- TypeScript for type-safe code
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Zustand for state management
- Vite for fast development

## Try It Out!

You can play the game right now at [bangla-abc-123.vercel.app](https://bangla-abc-123.vercel.app). It's completely free and open-source, just like how I believe educational resources should be.

For fellow developers interested in contributing or seeing how it works, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nadimtuhin/BanglaABC123).

## Impact and Future Plans

Watching my kids engage with the game and actually enjoy learning numbers in both languages has been incredibly rewarding. What started as a personal project for my children has grown into something that can help other families too.

I'm actively working on adding more features based on feedback from my kids and other parents. If you have ideas or want to contribute to making learning more fun for children, I'd love to hear from you!
