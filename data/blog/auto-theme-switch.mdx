summary: 'How I enhanced my website theme switcher to automatically adjust between light and dark modes based on time of day while preserving user preferences.'

As a developer who spends long hours coding, I understand the importance of having appropriate screen brightness and contrast throughout the day. While many websites offer dark mode toggles, I wanted to create something more intelligent - a theme switcher that automatically adjusts based on the time of day while still respecting user preferences.

## The Vision

I wanted to create a theme switcher that would:

- Automatically switch between light and dark modes based on time (6 AM - 6 PM)
- Allow users to override the automatic setting
- Remember user preferences using localStorage
- Provide clear visual feedback about the current mode
- Update in real-time as day transitions to night

## Implementation Details

The core of the implementation revolves around three main themes: 'auto', 'light', and 'dark'. Here's how the automatic mode works:

```javascript
const isDaytime = () => {
  const hours = new Date().getHours()
  return hours >= 6 && hours < 18
}
```

When in auto mode, the theme checks every minute if it's daytime:

```javascript
if (savedTheme === 'auto') {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    setTheme(isDaytime() ? 'light' : 'dark')
  }, 60000) // Update every minute
  return () => clearInterval(interval)
}
```

## User Experience Considerations

I paid special attention to the user experience:

1. **Smooth Transitions**: The theme switcher cycles through options: auto → light → dark → auto
2. **Informative Icons**: Each mode has a distinct icon (sun for light, moon for dark, half-circle for auto)
3. **Helpful Tooltips**: Added descriptive tooltips explaining each mode
4. **Persistence**: User preferences are saved in localStorage

## Technical Challenges

The main challenges involved:

- **Hydration**: Preventing theme flicker on initial load
- **State Management**: Handling theme state across components
- **Time-based Updates**: Implementing efficient time checks without excessive re-renders

## The Result

The final implementation provides a seamless experience where:

- Users entering the site during daytime see the light theme
- The theme automatically switches to dark mode after 6 PM
- Users can override the automatic setting at any time
- Their preferences persist across sessions

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements could include:

- Customizable time ranges for auto-switching
- Gradual transitions between themes
- System theme integration as another auto option

## Conclusion

This enhanced theme switcher demonstrates how small UX improvements can significantly impact user experience. By combining automatic time-based switching with user preferences, we've created a more intelligent and user-friendly theme system.

The complete implementation is available in my website's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nadimtuhin/nadimtuhin-nextjs), and you can see it in action right now in the navigation bar.
